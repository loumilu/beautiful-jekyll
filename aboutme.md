title: About me
---

My name is mintsuku and I am a junior developer, writing about the things of learned and thoughts I have as a junior developer, to other junior developers and hopefully I'll offer a fresh perspective to senior developers. I am a simple person:

- I **love** the rust programming language.
- I'm a junior developer.

There's really nothing else to say!

### Quirks

Well, I have ADHD and have a hard time remembering things like dates, times, places, birthdays... everything.
